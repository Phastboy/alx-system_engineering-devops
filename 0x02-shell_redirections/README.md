# Shell Redirections

- This is directory contains my solution to `ALX` `0x02-shell_redirections` tasks.
- Each file in this directory is the solution to a task.
- All files in this directory are scripts.

## Scripts

- `0-hello_world`: A script that prints “Hello, World”, followed by a new line to the standard output.
- `1-confused_smiley`: A script that displays a confused smiley `"(Ôo)'`.
- `2-hellofile`: Displays the content of the `/etc/passwd` file.
- `3-twofiles`: Displays the content of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/hosts`.
