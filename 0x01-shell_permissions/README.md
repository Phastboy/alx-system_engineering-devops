# Shell Permissions

- This is directory contains my solution to `ALX` `0x01-shell_permissions` tasks.
- Each file in this directory is the solution to a task.
- All files in this directory are scripts.

## Scripts

These are the scripts in this directory and what they do.

- `0-iam_betty`: Script that switches the current user to the user `betty`.
- `1-who_am_i`: Script that prints the effective username of the current user.
- `2-groups`: Script that prints all the groups the current user is part of.
- `3-new_owner`: Script that changes the owner of the file `hello` to the user `betty`.
