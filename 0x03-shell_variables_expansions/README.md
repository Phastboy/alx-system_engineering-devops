# Shell Variables And Expansions

- This is directory contains my solution to `ALX` `0x03-shell_variables_expansions` tasks.
- Each file in this directory is the solution to a task.
- All files in this directory are scripts.

## Scripts

- `0-alias`: A script that creates an alias.
    - Name: `ls`
    - Value: `rm *`

- `1-hello_you`:  A script that prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user.
